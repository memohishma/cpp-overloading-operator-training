# C++ Operator Overloading – Professional Training Summary

This repository documents my training progress and final summary after completing  
Ahmed Adel’s full **4-hour course on C++ Operator Overloading**.  
---

## 📘 Overview

Operator overloading in C++ allows extending built-in operators to work with user-defined types, improving code readability, abstraction, and expressiveness.  
This summary highlights the core concepts, design principles, and practical implementations learned throughout the training.

## 📌 Key Topics Covered

- Understanding the purpose and mechanics of **operator overloading**  
- Difference between **function overloading** and **operator overloading**  
- Implementing arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- Implementing comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`  
- Prefix & postfix overloads: `++obj`, `obj++`  
- Stream operator overloading:  
  - `operator<<` for output  
  - `operator>>` for input  
- Member functions vs **friend** functions: when and why to use each  
- Overloading the **assignment operator (`=`)**  
  - Shallow vs deep copy  
  - Memory-safe assignment  
- Copy constructor and the **Rule of Three**

## 🧪 Practical Implementations

- **Complex Number Class**: Arithmetic + comparison + stream operators  
- **Fraction / Rational Class**: Complete operator set with automatic reduction  
- **Student/Employee Comparison**: Relational operators for sorting and evaluation
