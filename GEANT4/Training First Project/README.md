.# Geant4 Learning Journey - Tutorial Projects

## 📁 Project Description
This project contains my **first hands-on Geant4 training code**, written while following 
the YouTube tutorial series by *Physics Matters*.  
I am manually typing every header (`.hh`) and source (`.cc`) file from the tutorial to help 
reinforce the structure, concepts, and workflow of Geant4 simulations.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository is **not** an original project.  
It is a **training and learning environment** where I rewrite the code shown in the tutorials 
to build familiarity with:
- Folder structure (`include/`, `src/`)
- Detector and geometry setup
- Physics lists
- Action initialization
- Primary generator
- CMake project structure


## 📚 Tutorial Source
- Channel: Physics Matters
- Series: Geant4 Tutorials (17 videos)
- Purpose: Practical learning and concept reinforcement

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand Geant4 project structure
- [ ] Master C++ implementation in simulation context  
- [ ] Build foundation for original BNCT research

## 💡 Note
These are tutorial-based implementations. My original research code for BNCT bone tumor simulation will be in separate repositories.

## 📅 Progress Tracking
- Start Date: [8/11/2025]
- Status: In Progress (7/17 tutorials completed)
