# Geant4 Training Projects

This folder contains my **Geant4 training projects**.  
Each subfolder here represents a separate Geant4 example or mini-project that I use for learning and practice.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The structure will roughly look like this:

- `GEANT4/`
  - `README.md`  ← (this file)
  - `basic_geometry/`
    - `src/`        → C++ source files (`.cc`, `.cpp`)
    - `include/`    → header files (`.hh`, `.h`)
    - `macros/`     → macro files (`.mac`)
    - `CMakeLists.txt`
  - `electromagnetic_physics/`
    - `src/`
    - `include/`
    - `macros/`
    - `CMakeLists.txt`
  - `...` (more training projects will be added later)

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice building Geant4 applications step by step  
- Organize each training project in its own folder  
- Separate **header** and **source** files using `include/` and `src/`  
- Use `CMakeLists.txt` for building each example

## 📝 Notes

All projects here are **educational and experimental**, created while learning Geant4 and related C++ concepts.
